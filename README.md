# S M A R T 

This app allows users to create goals using the acronym SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based. SMART goals are established by using these five components to ensure your goals are attainable within a certain time frame.

## Unsolved Problems and Major Hurdles
- There are some navigations issues I need to address: after ```sign up``` and ```login```, the page should navigate to ```/users``` along with the form you can see at ```/form```. 
- Initially I had a lot of trouble with user authentication and, with help, I was able to get it working! You can read about my struggles in my blog post [here](https://jaclyn-blinstrubas.medium.com/fourth-project-flop-42afc5320709).
- I had intended on using styled components to style this app. I taught myself the basics, but with the project deadline and other basic functionality not working, I nixed styled components for now and went back to CSS.
- I plan on practicing and updating this app with styled components.
- This app would be likely be used on mobile devices, therefor my goal is to style it with media queries for a better mobile experience. 
- I had big plans for this capstone project, however, due to time restraints I was unable to get everything in. I am looking forward to conitnue to work on and implement new features as I continue to learn!
