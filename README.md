## Unsolved Problems and Major Hurdles
- I was unable to deploy a completed app. I could not get user authentication sorted out, and could not connect the front and back end. I look forward to working on this and spending the time to really understand it. 
- I tought myself styled components to style this app. I can see the benefits of styling this way, but its been tough to wrap my head around for this first time implementing it. 
- I am excited to practice these issues further to better understand how they work, and to become more comfortable with it. 
- I was unable to add media queries for better viewing on mobile devices.
